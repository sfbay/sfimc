## Part 1: Current SFIMC Design System Analysis

### Typography System
- **Display Font**: Fraunces (variable, serif) - used for headlines and editorial content
- **Body Font**: DM Sans - clean sans-serif for readability
- **Accent Font**: JetBrains Mono - monospace for labels and technical elements

### Color Palette
| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `--color-dot` | `#ff4f1f` | Primary accent, "The Dot" brand element |
| `--color-teal` | `#0b525b` | Coalition teal, secondary brand color |
| `--color-ink` | `#1a1a1a` | Primary text |
| `--color-paper` | `#faf9f7` | Light backgrounds |
| `--color-chalk` | `#f5f3ef` | Subtle background variation |

### Current Component Inventory
- Hero section with headline and subheadline

### Identified Weaknesses
1. **Static presentation** - lacks dynamic, engaging elements
2. **Wireframe-literal implementation** - follows theoretical structure too closely
3. **Limited interactivity** - minimal hover states and transitions
4. **Underutilized brand colors** - The Dot and Coalition Teal not leveraged effectively
5. **No community features** - no visible member engagement or participation elements
6. **Generic card layouts** - nothing distinguishes journalism content from standard blog
